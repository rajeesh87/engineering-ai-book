# Chapter 9: Predictive Maintenance, Quality & Operations

## 🛠️ The Shift from Reactive to Predictive

Traditional maintenance has been largely reactive or scheduled at fixed intervals. This often leads to unnecessary downtime or unexpected failures. Predictive maintenance, powered by AI, transforms this approach by anticipating issues before they happen.

By analyzing sensor data, usage patterns, and environmental factors, predictive systems identify early warning signs, allowing timely interventions.

## 📊 Data-Driven Quality Control

Quality assurance is evolving from manual inspections to AI-augmented monitoring:

- **Computer vision** inspects products on assembly lines with high precision.
- **Anomaly detection algorithms** catch subtle defects invisible to the human eye.
- **Process analytics** optimize manufacturing parameters to reduce variability and waste.

This data-driven approach increases consistency and lowers costs.

## 🤖 AI at the Heart of Operations

AI is embedded across operational workflows:

- **Supply chain optimization** uses predictive analytics to manage inventory and logistics proactively.
- **Resource allocation** adapts dynamically based on demand forecasting.
- **Energy management** reduces consumption by predicting peak loads and adjusting accordingly.

These capabilities improve efficiency and sustainability.

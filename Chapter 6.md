## üîç The Role of Context and Protocol in Physical Systems

In these disciplines, the **MCP model** (Model‚ÄìContext‚ÄìProtocol) plays a crucial role in ensuring AI solutions perform reliably:

- **Model:** Predictive or control algorithms.
- **Context:** Environmental conditions, sensor accuracy, system constraints.
- **Protocol:** Safety and regulatory requirements, communication interfaces, fail-safe mechanisms.

For example, a predictive maintenance model must consider the **context** of machine load variations and environmental factors, while the **protocol** ensures alerts trigger safe shutdowns or maintenance schedules.

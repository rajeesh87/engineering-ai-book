# Foreword: The Dawn of Intelligent Engineering  
*by Dr. Udaylal Pai*

As someone who has spent decades exploring the intersections of tradition, technology, and truth, I am honored to write the foreword to a book that seeks to reshape how we perceive engineering in the age of artificial intelligence.

"Engineering Everything: Why the Future Demands AI and Advanced Technologies" by Rajeesh Shenoy is more than just a guide to technical evolution—it is a manifesto for engineers to remain relevant, conscious, and constructive in a rapidly transforming world.

I have often spoken and written about how our ancient seers viewed knowledge as a tool for higher understanding—not just material success. In today’s context, AI is such a tool. Like fire, it can cook food or burn homes. Its outcome depends not just on the algorithm, but on the human intent behind it. Rajeesh recognizes this clearly.

He is not merely advocating for engineers to use AI. He is urging them to **become AI-native thinkers**—to embrace intelligence augmentation, ethical awareness, and systems thinking. He argues persuasively that traditional engineering is no longer enough. As machines evolve to solve problems we once considered uniquely human, engineers must also evolve: not by resisting the wave, but by learning to surf it with purpose.

What impressed me most in this book is Rajeesh’s vision: he does not present AI as a silver bullet, but as a mirror—reflecting back the values, biases, and intentions of its creators. He makes a compelling case that **conscious engineering** is no longer optional. It is the very foundation upon which future societies will be built.

To young engineers, this book will be a roadmap. To experienced professionals, it will be a call to reinvent. And to leaders, it is a clarion warning: ignore AI at your peril, but wield it without wisdom, and you risk even greater harm.

The Bhagavad Gita reminds us: *"Yogah karmasu kaushalam" — Yoga is excellence in action.* This book shows how AI, when used with excellence and awareness, can elevate engineering into a form of modern-day yoga—aligning action, intelligence, and purpose.

Read this not just with your mind, but with your conscience.
